# JB_MappingRuns
NGS project #406 Jacques B.

I would to collect here all the runs done for the various mapping runs for Jacques B. 

The scripts uses snakemake for mapping the chipseq and ATAC-Seq data sets against the Drosophile Melanogaster and Drosophila Pseudoobscura. After that the bam files are indexed and sorted and converted into bigwig files for better visualization.
