In the list of projects done with Jacque B in the Moeller lab I have also two more projects containing only bam files. 

The first project, which is called in the folder strucutre 2nd.Dataset, was done apparently also on May 2018 and the bam files contains the prefix `2229`.

the second project, which in the folder strucutre is called 3rd.Dataset, was done on November 2016 and has the number 2230 as prefix.
